console.fog

============

`console.fog` is a simple way to light up your web apps.
Runs on vanilla JavaScript, in most modern browsers.

### Preview

Here's what a super lame web project's console looks like:

```javascript
console.log('I am bored out of my mind.');
```
```
// And here is your output.
> I am bored out of my mind.
```

Wow. I can't believe you've had to deal with this crap.

```javascript
console.fog('I am a leaf in the wind.');
```
```
// And here is your output.
                      (   I am a leaf in the wind.   )
                       ) (
   ___________________(  )
  ()__)____________)))))  
```

Holy turd. If this doesn't make you wanna poop your pants from the thrill of web
development, I honestly don't know what will.

### Usage

Just include the `console.fog.js` file into your app!
